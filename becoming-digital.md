## Becoming digital


When the world was only analog, puppies roamed freely. Frolicking thorugh fields, and eating all of the treats they could ever ask for. It was a simpler time. Years later, cats came to destroy everything they once knew.

When the world was only analog, I was but a child. I never knew what the future held, but I knew we needed files.
