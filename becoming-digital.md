## Becoming digital

When the world was only analog, limitations roamed free.
People's imagination stuck in time with their means of expression.
The physical world of what is as opposed to what will be defined humanity.

If the world were only digital, the truth is assumed.
No physical evidence left behind.
Imagination is the only limitation known to man, and yet even in a world of endless possibilities, humanity falls short.
