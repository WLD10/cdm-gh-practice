## Becoming digital

When the world was only analog, puppies roamed freely. Frolicking thorugh fields, and eating all of the treats they could ever ask for. It was a simpler time. Years later, cats came to destroy everything they once knew.

When the world was only analog, I was but a child. I never knew what the future held, but I knew we needed files.

When the world was only analog,
There was no knowledge. There was no joy.

When the world was only analog,
I would set a list of things I want to achieve, and make all the things into a way I hope it to be.

When the world was only analog, 
people lived the same day over and over again. 
It was boring 
and nobody knew what to do with themselves. 
It was scary. 
Now there is change.
