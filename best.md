At first, there was only analog:

And then there was digital!

It may seem like it has not been long

But it quickly became vital

There's not a day that goes by

without digital photos sent on the fly

bits and bytes wizzing through the sky

even my grandma gave Instagram a try!

Zeros and ones made in a flash

I wrote this message with the Git Bash

No pull request, feeling quite rash

but I got new skills, that new badge my sash
