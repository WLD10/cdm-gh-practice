# Introduction to GitHub

Welcome! Today we're going to learn about GitHub and how to use it for _version control_ – that is, to keep track of changes in a set of files.

## Where we are

You're in a **repository**, often abbreviated to **repo**, which is just a fancy way of saying a _folder_. It's a bunch of files. It can have subfolders inside it.  See the files and folders up above this text?

This text is, itself, coming from a single file inside the repository, with the special name of **README.md**. Anything appearing in the README file will show up here, on the repo's landing page.

The file extension, '.md', refers to _Markdown_, a simple syntax for signaling display formats (bold, italic, bullets, headings, etc) in plain text files. As you can see here, GitHub knows how to render markup like `**repo**` in bold and `_folder_` in italics. There are many more features; as an EXT, you could check out an [overview of Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) you can use.

Markdown lets you link not only to other websites, but also to other files in the repo, like [this-is-just-to-say.txt](this-is-just-to-say.txt). Let's look at that one together!

## When it's time for your turn

You'll find the instructions in [your-turn.md](your-turn.md).
